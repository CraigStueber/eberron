		<h1 class='green center'>City of Towers</h1>
		<p>	Sharn is the most populous city in all of Khorvaire, and arguably all of Eberron. The city literally towers atop a 		cliff above the mouth of the Dagger River in southern Breland.
			Sharn is known as The City of Towers, but has also been called many other names, including The City of Knives, The City of Lost Souls, The City of a Thousand Eyes, the Gateway to Xen'drik, and The Gateway to Perdition. Sharn looms atop the cliffs overlooking the Hilt, a bay at the mouth of the Dagger River in southern Breland. The city sits upon the foundation of an ancient hobgoblin city. Below that, a rumored lake of molten lava rests, but its presence can be felt only in the lowest parts of Sharn, the Cogs.</p>
	</div>
	<div class='col-12 box'>
		<div class="row">
		<div class='col-lg-3 district'><h3 class='green'>Central Plateau</h3><p>Central Plateau is the heart of Sharn. Its top levels include the seat of the city’s government and its bustling finance districts. Its middle levels host the enclaves of the dragonmarked houses (which some describe as the real government of the city) and embassies of the other nations of Khorvaire. Its location makes its residential neighborhoods highly desirable and its marketplace perhaps the busiest in the city.</p></div>
		<div class='col-lg-3 district'><h3 class='green'>Menthis Plateau</h3><p>The Menthis Plateau is the hub of Sharn’s entertainment industry, as well as its most diverse ethnic quarter and the seat of Morgrave University. Its districts include Den’iyas (also called Little Zilargo because of its large gnome population), Everbright (the city’s only magic district), and two theater districts, Torchfire and Smoky Towers. Like the Central Plateau, its location allows it to draw visitors from all over the city to sample its entertainment offerings, and it also draws tourists from across the Five Nations.</p></div>
		<div class='col-lg-3 district'><h3 class='green'>Northedge</h3><p>Northedge, one of the quietest regions within Sharn, is a residential quarter. Most of its inhabitants are crafters and commoners, people who make an honest living within the great city. As a result, it is an uncommon destination for adventurers. However, a variety of tradesfolk and artisans work out of their North edge homes, and it is possible that a party will be recommended to one of the Northedge specialists.In addition, if an adventurer wants to take up residence within Sharn, the prices in Northedge are quite reasonable.</p></div>
		<div class='col-lg-3 district'><h3 class='green'>Dura</h3><p>Dura, one of the largest and oldest quarter of Sharn, rises from the ruins Shaarat and the Old Sharn that fell at the end of the War of the Mark. But as Sharn has grown over the centuries since that terrible conflict, Dura has been left behind. Today, many consider it a blight on the city, riddled as it is with poverty and crime. Dura is home to the majority of the lower classes of Sharn, and Lower Dura is generally considered to be little better than the Cogs.</p></div>
		<div class='col-lg-3 district'><h3 class='green'>Tavick's Landing</h3> <p>For most travelers, Tavick’s Landing is the gateway to Sharn. The Orien lightning rail station at Terminus brings in hundreds of travelers each day, and many more arrive via the Old Road at Wroanns Gate. In many ways, Tavick’s Landing is the most eclectic quarter of Sharn, blending residential areas with commercial and entertainment districts that cater to the traders, travelers, and tourists who pass through the city. </p></div>
		<div class='col-lg-3 district'><h3 class='green'>Cogs</h3> <p>The towers of Sharn reach up to the sky. But its tunnels also stretch down into the earth. Far below the forgotten ruins of the Depths, these undercity warrens are known as the Cogs. The great furnaces and foundries of the Cogs form the industrial base of Sharn. The borders of the different Cogs “districts” are not as clearly defined as they are on the surface, but there are a few well-known (and often infamous) areas.</p></div>
		<div class='col-lg-3 district'><h3 class='green'>Skyway</h3><p>Skyway demonstrates the most dramatic manifestation of the magic made possible by Sharn’s manifest zone linked to Syrania. Its towers are built on clouds given substance, hovering above the tops of the buildings below. The residents of Skyway are the impossibly wealthy and privileged, the aristocrats who might hope never to dirty their feet by setting them on a street in the city below.</p></div>
		<div class='col-lg-3 district'><h3 class='green'>Cliffside</h3> <p>The Cliffside ward makes up the lower edge of Dura, built on and into the cliffs that drop toward the river. This waterfront district, full of businesses that cater to the sailors who pass through Sharn’s port, can be a rough and tumble place. Legitimate services can be found here—ships need supplies and repairs, goods need to be stored, captains need a place to hire a crew, and sailors need a bed on dry land to sleep in once in a while—but other businesses spring up simply to meet demand.</p></div>
	</div></div>
	<div class='col-12 dura'>
		<h1 class='green'>Dura</h1>
		<p>Where the majority of our Sharn adventures will be had.</p>
	</div>
	<div class='row dura'>
		<div class='col-lg-6'><h3 class='green'>Sewers of Dura</h3>
			<p>The upper wards of Sharn use an ingeniously devised network of chutes to funnel garbage down into the sewers. Garbage and filth is channeled into cavernous midden chambers, where it is left to rot or be devoured by the vermin and oozes that inhabit the sewers. Smaller tunnels channel wastewater to purification centers, where magewrights employ stones of purity to cleanse the water. A special unit of the Sharn Watch protects the purification chambers. Beyond these small, vital areas, the sewers are completely lawless. The tunnels and midden chambers are unlit, and vermin and oozes are common throughout the region.
			While the sewers were never intended to support a population, over the centuries a subculture has evolved in this region that lies directly below the Lower-City. There are treasures to be found in the midden heaps—or if not treasure, at least objects that can be resold for a few coppers. A few tribes of people—mostly goblins, along with a few shifters, dwarves, and feral halflings and gnomes—live in the sewers, rummaging through the midden heaps and selling their goods in impromptu “rat’s markets” in the Lower-City. These sewer clans are constantly battling over territory, as control of midden chambers is critical to the survival of a clan. The sewer clans can pose a threat to adventurers who travel to the Depths, but they can also be valuable allies; there are no better guides to the sewers and the Depths than one of the cellar dwellers.</p></div>
		<div class='col-lg-6'><h3 class='green'>Lower Dura</h3>
			<p>
				Once the heart of Sharn, Lower Dura has slowly decayed as the rest of the city moved higher into the sky. Now it is a dark and dangerous place. Precarious and the Stores play important roles in the economy of the city, but the other districts have largely been left to fester and rot. Today, Lower Dura is home to the miserable poor. The Sharn Watch rarely risks patrolling Lower Dura, and the ward has become a center for criminal activities. The inhabitants of the ward may be shielded by gang allegiances, ties to one of the major criminal organizations, or the simple fact of having nothing to steal, but adventurers had best tread lightly and keep weapons near at hand when venturing here. Street violence occurs on a regular basis, amateur and professional cutpurses abound, and the Sharn Watch won’t do much to help. 
			In general, Lower Dura is a wretched place, and the city council does little to change that. Everburning torches light most of the district, as opposed to everbright lanterns, and in the worst neighborhoods many of the torches have been shattered or stolen. The ward shows its age, with cracked and worn streets, walls covered with mildew and graffiti, and other signs of neglect and wear and tear. Once Lower Dura was Sharn, and it included a garrison, manors for the city lords, a great temple, and other important buildings. Over the course of time these structures have been forgotten or repurposed. Lower Dura is full of the shadows of a glorious past that can barely be seen beneath the grime of the present.</p></div>
		
	</div>
	<div class='row box dura'>
		<div class='col-lg-6'><h3 class='green'>Middle Dura</h3>
			<p>The stones in this old district have been worn smooth by the passage of time. There is a definite scent of danger in the air. The Sharn Watch patrols this ward, and these guards are always ready for trouble—though the crime lords often use bribes to ensure that the Watch is nowhere to be seen when certain activities take place. Nonetheless, Middle Dura is certainly safer than the ward that lies below. The Bazaar, the largest market in the city, can be found here, and the taverns and inns of Dura are a common destination for folk who don’t have many coins to rub together.</p>
		</div>
		<div class='col-lg-6'><h3 class='green'>Upper Dura</h3>
			<p>Physically and economically, Upper Dura has little in common with the slums and tenements that lie below it. The upper towers were erected over the past few centuries, and the stonework refl ects the prosperity of Breland and the city. If the ward is not as fancy or prestigious as Central Plateau or Northedge, at least the streets are clean and in good repair. However, while many of the people of Upper Dura are successful merchants or crafters, there is a seedy edge to the ward. Beggars can be found throughout the ward, flaunting their afflictions and misfortunes in hopes of earning pity and coppers. Dreamlily dens and other forms of high-class crime can be found in the shadows. The people are comfortable with strangers and others of questionable character—so adventurers are made welcome.</p>
		</div>
		
	</div>
	<div class='col-12 box'><h1 class='green'>City of the Dead</h1>
		<p>The dead of Sharn are often cremated these days, but in the city’s youth (and still, to some extent, at least among the wealthy) they were more commonly entombed in mausoleums and crypts in the City of the Dead, high on the cliffs surrounding the city. These districts are nearly deserted in contrast to the bustling streets and towers of Sharn. Buildings are spread apart by hundreds of yards, and the only residents are caretakers, priests (not necessarily clerics) responsible for offering prayers to the ancestors of important families, and more necromancers than anyone would care to admit. The City of the Dead lies outside of the manifest zone linked to Syrania. Magic items, spells, and feats that take advantage of the manifest zone do not function in the City of the Dead.</p></div>
